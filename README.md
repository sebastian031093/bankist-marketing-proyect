# Proyecto bankist Marketing 

bankist is an app that simulates the layout of a banking website that provides banking services.

Using javascript techniques you can navigate harmoniously in this app, from the nav to all its composition, the call to action in the main menu displays a popup in which there is a registration form and when you scroll over the page the sections are displayed in a subtle way, but dynamically.
